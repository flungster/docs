# docs
various docs I've accumulated while developing stuff personally
* [OS X personal development setup](OSXDEV.md)

# TO DO projects
* Learn Go development
* Learn Spring Boot framework (I've been using DropWizard for so long now)
* Setup a system to train recommendation engines
* Play with Alexa Skills one of these days. Need to come up with something that would actually be useful via Alexa.
