The following is a list of tasks I've done to setup a new development environment on OS X. This is of course specific to my needs which are primarily focused on setting up a Java development environment but could include other languages over time.

# Common OS X Tasks
Download and install the following:
* iTerm2 - terminal replacement
* XCode from the App Store
* XCode command line utilities
* Java 8 from Oracle
* Homebrew
* git

# Setup Vagrant and VirtualBox
* Install VirtualBox
* Install Vagrant
* Install the Guest Plugin:

```vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest```

* Setup your own box
