I enjoy running. If you do too, then you might find the following links helpful (and if you do enjoy running then chances are, you are already familiar with the following links).

# Running Tools
* [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) - there's a lot of great running social networks out there but honestly, there's nothing quite like Strava. 
* [Athlinks](https://www.athlinks.com/) - I've yet to really decide if this is truly useful but it seems like a good place to aggregate all of your races.
* [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/en-US/) - IMHO - a Garmin sports watch is the standards bearer in the field of wearables. I have a [Forerunner 935](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/564291) which I absolutely love. I also do appreciate the [Fenix 5](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/552982) but the FR935 is a much better bang for the buck.
