# Useful Apps/Tools for OS X
* [Magnet](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) (if you're coming from a Windows world, you'll love this app as it allows you to easily snap windows side to side; fullscreen etc.). 
* [Avira](https://www.avira.com/) - Mac antivirus
* I miss Wunderlist but Microsoft is no longer supporting it.. so I'm giving [todoist](https://en.todoist.com/) a try
